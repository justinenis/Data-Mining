1. In this boxplot, we are assesing whether the lack of direct competition in
sight results in higher gas prices. The boxplot is separated into two categories, yes or no, on whether a competitor is within sight of the observed gas station. I also added color to better differentiate between both categories.
When interpreting the boxplot, it becomes clear that the lack of direct
competition in sight results in higher gas prices. The median price of gas stations with no competitors in sight is approximately $1.89/gal, while in contrast, the median price of gas stations with competitors in sight is $1.85/gal. Moreover, gas stations with no direct competitors in sight have a larger range of prices, relative to gas stations with direct competitors in sight.
